Your tags need be typed in as one word per tag entry. They will show up within a yellow rectangle with rounded edges. 

## Subtasks
When a reminder is created, at first that reminder will not have a subtask. Subtasks can be added when you go to the single reminders page and add subtasks manually. When the user presses "add" underneath Subtask, a new box will show and the user will be able to type their subtask into the box. The user will then press "Submit" to add the subtask to the list of subtasks. These subtasks will only be shown when the user accesses the single reminder page. Subtasks can be deleted when the "Delete" button is clicked.
